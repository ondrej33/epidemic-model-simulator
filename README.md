# Epidemic model simulator

Application for deterministic simulation of simple epidemic models like SIR, SIRS, SEIR. Allows the user to specify initial conditions, parameters and also time events.

Application has two modes. 
In the first one, user prepares model-describing files and uploads them to the application. Simulation is performed and pictures with the resulting plots are given as output.
The second mode is more interactive, user can define model through the GUI, change parameters, add/remove events and watch the changes in simulations.

It is a Windows Forms application written in C#, and it was developed as a semestral project for the PV178 course at FI MU.
